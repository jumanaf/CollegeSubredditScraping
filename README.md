# CollegeSubreddit--Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to follow a simple BeautifulSoup tutorial to analyze overall sentiments in different college subreddits. Generally, different colleges have different overall cultures, and I wanted to see which colleges might have a more positive subreddit community, and which might be more negative.

The college subreddits were obtained from this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlding/college-subreddits/master/data/colleges.csv

A tutorial that was loosely followed to conduct this sentiment analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xZAISu-5E&t=635s
